[about]
content = "We launched the Webinars in June 2020 on Facebook, in line with our goals to provide workshops and masterclasses by expert local and international music professionals. Our Webinars aim to introduce educational, enriching music content of diverse natures; some of the topics weâ€™ve covered include Music Therapy, Introduction to Arabic Music, and Nai Instrument Making among other topics. Moreover, in spirit of our enthusiasm to collaborate with like-minded music entities, our July 2020 Webinar series was delivered in partnership with Jeunesses Musicales du Liban. Continuously, we plan on evolving these Webinars with more and more far-reaching topics.  "
